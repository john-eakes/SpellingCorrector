# SpellingCorrector
The spelling corrector program takes in a file with commonly misspelled words, the correct spelling of each word, and then a paragraph that may have spelling mistakes. If the spelling mistake had been previously defined and corrected in that file, it will be corrected in the paragraph, and a final corrected version of the paragraph is printed.
