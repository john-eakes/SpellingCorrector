Dear Mr. McBean,

It is the concensus of the comittee
that your absense for the last three
months is an abuse of the company
telecommuting policy.  We have tried
to accomodate your "eccentric" work
style, but your tendency to mispell
and occasional plagarism make your
work a definate embarrassment to the
company.  Tommorrow is basicly your
last chance to demonstrate the good
work we think you're capable of.

           Sincerely

           Quality Oversight Comittee
