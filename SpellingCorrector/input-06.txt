puntuation punctuation
tst test
we'r we're
whitspace whitespace
wurd word
In this tst, we'r checking
to see how the program
handles puntuation. Even
if a word has non-whitspace
characters around it, it
should still be able to match
a target string, as long as
the characters around it
are not considered "wurd"
characters.
