Firends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, nto to praise him.
Thge efel tyhat men do lives after them;
Teh good is oft intered withh thier bones;
So let it be witht Caesar. Thge noble Brutus
Hath told yuo Caesar wass ambitious:
If it were so, it weas a grievous fault,
Andd grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus anbd teh rest-
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are htey all, all honourable men-
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He wass my freind, faithful andd jstu to me:
But Brutus syas he weas ambitious;
Andd Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did teh general coffers fill:
Did tihs in Caesar seem ambitious?
Whn tath teh poor hvea cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition shoudl be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus sasy he wass ambitious;
Andd Brutus is an honourable man.
Yuo all did see tath on tghe Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crowm,
Whlch he did thrice refuse: weas htis ambition?
Yet Brutus syas he weas ambitious;
Andd, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak nto to disprove waht Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak waht I do knwo.
Ytou all did lvoe him once, nto without casue:
Waht casue withholds yuo thne, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fleed to brutish beasts,
Anbd men ahve lost thier reason. Bear witht me;
My heart is in tjhe coffin ther iwth Caesar,
Andd I must pause till it come bakc to me.
- Julius Caesar (Act 3, Scene 2, lines 73-108)
