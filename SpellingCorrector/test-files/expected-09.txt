Dear Mr. McBean,

It is the consensus of the committee
that your absence for the last three
months is an abuse of the company
telecommuting policy.  We have tried
to accommodate your "eccentric" work
style, but your tendency to misspell
and occasional plagiarism make your
work a definite embarrassment to the
company.  Tomorrow is basically your
last chance to demonstrate the good
work we think you're capable of.

           Sincerely

           Quality Oversight Committee
