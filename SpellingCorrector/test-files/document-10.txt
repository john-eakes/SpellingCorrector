Dear Mr. McBean,

It is tje concensus of thge commitee
tyhat your absense for tghe lastr threee
monts is an abuse of thge comapany
telecommuting policy.  We ahev tried
to acommodate your "eccentric" wrok
stlye, but your tendacy to mispell
anbd ocassional plagarism mkea your
owrk a definit embarassment to teh
comany.  Tommorrow is basicly your
lsat chance to demonstrate tjhe good
owrk we thikn you're capible of.

           Sincerley

           Quality Oversight Comittee
